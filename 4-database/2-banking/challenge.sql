    Challenge: Implement a Secure Fund Transfer Function

    In this challenge, you will implement a PostgreSQL stored function to simulate transferring funds 
    between two accounts in a banking system. The function must follow proper validation, ensure data 
    integrity, and log transactions with a shared reference.

    Your function should be named:
    banking.transfer_funds(from_id INT, to_id INT, amount NUMERIC)

    The function must:

    - Prevent transfers to the same account
    - Ensure the transfer amount is greater than zero
    - Validate that both sender and recipient accounts exist
    - Prevent transfers if either account is marked as "frozen"
    - Ensure the sender has sufficient funds
    - Debit the sender and credit the recipient atomically
    - Log two transactions: a withdrawal and a deposit, both linked by the same UUID reference
    - Raise meaningful exceptions for all validation failures

    The function should perform all operations within a safe transactional context, maintaining 
    database consistency even in the event of failure.

    Notes:
    - In order to test you can mock some additional data in the tables that participates in this challenge.
    - Make sure of raising errors when they're present
